In side of $2r$, then the overlapping particles start pushing each other apart.\n",

For `IXPushPair(ix,p1,p2)`, it is suspectible to race condition when we parallelize the code, so `#pragma omp critical` is added to both locations to ensure no race condition happens. To sum up, this kernel was changed to:\n",

A larger `boxdim` breaks down the computation work within each box (each inner most interation) into multiple piles of work, which is easier to be parallelized. Also, boxdim of 8 tends to fit the right amount data into the cache lines so data is fetched faster.   \n",

    "## Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "- **My experience in the past:** Detailed git histories are correlated with better performance!\n",
    "- **Understand your code before you try to change it:**\n",
    "    - In addition to profiling utilities, it might be useful to add timers to\n",
    "      individual routines.  The division of the program into objects that control\n",
    "      different aspects of the code should make easy to, say, add a timer\n",
    "      in one place without changing the whole program.\n",
    "- **Simple problem parameters that can be changed:**\n",
    "    - The number of boxes per dimension\n",
    "    - The layout of vectors (array-of-structures or structure of arrays? see `vector.h`)\n",
    "    - The data structures used to assign particles to boxes (is a linked-list really best)?\n",
    "- **Avoid memory and other resource contention:**\n",
    "    - Anytime multiple threads are trying to write to locations close to each\n",
    "      other, it makes it difficult and expensive to make sure each thread has\n",
    "      an up-to-date copy of the memory that is changing.  This would happen,\n",
    "      for example, if many threads are writing to the `pairs` list in\n",
    "      the interactions routine.  Consider allocating a separate workspace for\n",
    "      each thread by, for example, giving each thread its own `pairs` array.\n",
    "      Then, once all threads are done computing their pairs, you can combine\n",
    "      the separate arrays into one array, or even change the interface of the\n",
    "      `interactions()` function so that it is multiple lists are returned.\n",
    "- **Find ways to avoid recomputing from scratch:**\n",
    "    - Can you use the layout of the particles from the last time step to help you\n",
    "      bin or find pairs in the next time step?\n",
    "- **You get to choose how many threads we use to evaluate your code:**\n",
    "    - There's nothing inherently wrong with achieving your best performance\n",
    "      using fewer than the maximum number of threads available on a node.  The\n",
    "      problem may simply not have enough concurrency to support every thread.\n",
    "- **Read through these performance slides for ideas:** [From Archer](https://www.archer.ac.uk/training/course-material/2015/12/ShMem_OpenMP_York/Slides/L09-performance.pdf)\n",
