In side of $2r$, then the overlapping particles start pushing each other apart.\n",

Since the amount of work is the same for each iteration in the most inner loop, `schedule(static)` and `collapse(3)` were used. Besides, the pairs are updated with PushPair and most of the variables are only presented and used in this kernel, they were changed to private variables to boost the performance. For `IXPushPair(ix,p1,p2)`, it is suspectible to race condition when we parallelize the code, so `#pragma omp critical` is added to ensure no race condition happens.

A larger `boxdim` breaks down the computation work within each box (each inner most interation) into multiple piles of work, which is easier to be parallelized. Also, boxdim of 8 tends to fit the right amount data into the cache lines so data is fetched faster.   \n",

    "## Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "- **My experience in the past:** Detailed git histories are correlated with better performance!\n",
    "- **Understand your code before you try to change it:**\n",
    "    - In addition to profiling utilities, it might be useful to add timers to\n",
    "      individual routines.  The division of the program into objects that control\n",
    "      different aspects of the code should make easy to, say, add a timer\n",
    "      in one place without changing the whole program.\n",
    "- **Simple problem parameters that can be changed:**\n",
    "    - The number of boxes per dimension\n",
    "    - The layout of vectors (array-of-structures or structure of arrays? see `vector.h`)\n",
    "    - The data structures used to assign particles to boxes (is a linked-list really best)?\n",
    "- **Avoid memory and other resource contention:**\n",
    "    - Anytime multiple threads are trying to write to locations close to each\n",
    "      other, it makes it difficult and expensive to make sure each thread has\n",
    "      an up-to-date copy of the memory that is changing.  This would happen,\n",
    "      for example, if many threads are writing to the `pairs` list in\n",
    "      the interactions routine.  Consider allocating a separate workspace for\n",
    "      each thread by, for example, giving each thread its own `pairs` array.\n",
    "      Then, once all threads are done computing their pairs, you can combine\n",
    "      the separate arrays into one array, or even change the interface of the\n",
    "      `interactions()` function so that it is multiple lists are returned.\n",
    "- **Find ways to avoid recomputing from scratch:**\n",
    "    - Can you use the layout of the particles from the last time step to help you\n",
    "      bin or find pairs in the next time step?\n",
    "- **You get to choose how many threads we use to evaluate your code:**\n",
    "    - There's nothing inherently wrong with achieving your best performance\n",
    "      using fewer than the maximum number of threads available on a node.  The\n",
    "      problem may simply not have enough concurrency to support every thread.\n",
    "- **Read through these performance slides for ideas:** [From Archer](https://www.archer.ac.uk/training/course-material/2015/12/ShMem_OpenMP_York/Slides/L09-performance.pdf)\n",
