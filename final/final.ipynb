    "\n",
    "### b. Report a machine-independent measure of performance, to allow for fair comparison and portability.\n",

    "\n",
    "With these criteria in mind, you are welcome to select any accepted community benchmark with an open-source implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The benchmark implementation must be *open*, so that we may see what exactly is being run.\n",

Do you think the benchmark you chose does a good job with this balance?\n",
    "\n",

Let's make this question very concrete: let's say you have access to [TaihuLight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunway_TaihuLight), whose nodes are neither really CPUs or GPUs, but somewhere in between.  Could your benchmark run on this machine?  If not, propose a way that you could change the benchmark to make it more portable.\n",

If your benchmark is for a particular algorithm or a particular code, do you think that the results of the benchmark would help you predict the performance of a different code/algorithm solving the same problem on the same machine?\n",
    "\n",
    "- d. One measure of the complexity of a benchmark is how difficult it would be to write a reference implementation from scratch (one that solves the problem, if not in a \"high-performance\" way).  If you had to guess, how big would a team have to be do that: (i) one dedicated programmer; (ii) a team of about a dozen (like a research lab); (iii) an Organization (like a division of a company or a government agency)?

So we selected a N=11647, which is ten times smaller than that. For Block size, we also followed the recommendation to choose a value in the [32 , 256] interval. In our example, we selected 32, 64, 128, 256. Because the example test was performed on one node (chip), each core can be considered closely connected. Hence, 2 by 4 grid was set. **Example job submission script can be found in `cse6230-hw/final/script/pl_example.sh`**."

    "\n",
    "**a. What is the problem being solved?**   \n",
    "  \n",
    "A: It improves the computational efficiency of ab initio quantum transport (QT) solver. Large-scale QT simulations are bound by both communication volume and memory requirements. The former inhibits strong scaling, as simulation time includes nanostructure-dependent point-to-point communication patterns, which become infeasible when increasing node count. The memory bottleneck is a direct result of the former.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**b.What are the most important kernels of the algorithm for solving the problem? (In this context consider a kernel to be a subproblem that is relevant to more than just the specific problem from a.)**   \n",
    "   \n",
    "A: They showed that the key to eliminating the scaling bottleneck is in formulating a communication-avoiding algorithm, which is tightly coupled with recovering local and global data dependencies of the application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important kernel is solving scattering self-energies (SSE) equations $\\Sigma (E,k_z)$ and $\\Pi (\\omega, q_z)$. 95% of simulation time is dedicated to SSE, regardless of the number of used cores/nodes, among which ∼60% for the communication between the different MPI tasks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The method they used in the paper was a Data-Centric(DaCe) SSE, which reduces magnitudes of data movement and communications between ranks.  \n",
    "**c. What about the important kernels and/or the size of the problem make this a challenging problem?**   \n",
    "  \n",
    "A: SSE are required to be evaluated for all $\\Sigma (E,k_z)$ and $\\Pi (\\omega, q_z)$, so the computation cost increases with the number of atoms simulated. However, understanding realistic FinFET transistors requires simulations with $N_a ≥ 10, 000$ atoms and high accuracy. The SSE phase comsumption in SOTA result (OMEN) before this DaCe approch grows with the cores used, which could be attributed to communication overhead. To simulate the disired number of atoms with required accuracy, two orders of magnitude improvement in computation time per atom has to be made.    \n",
    "**d. Summarize the innovation of this paper.**   \n",
    "  \n",
    "A: The innovations reported includes: \n",
    "1. Material was staged and chunked broadcasted to nodes, so data ingestion was ~15 times faster.  \n",
    "2. Domain decomposation of SSE computation was tiled by atom position on the nano device instead of being controled by the top map as in OMEN. This modification reduces the movement needed and the complexity in MPI communications. \n",
    "3. Many kinds of computation were pipelined on GPU. For instance, contour integral calculation for boundary condition was pipelined. Copy/compute and compute/compute overlap were automatically generated by DaCe framework. \n",
    "4. In Green's Function (GF) computation, they investigated different DaCe transformation on sparse Hamiltonian blocks using a combination of sparse and dense matrices. \n",
    "5. Dataflow in SSE kernel was reformulated to provide speedup. For example, using map fission and data layout transformation, they reshaped the job into a stencil-like strided-batched dense multiplication, which yeiled ~5x speedup over cuBLAS.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "**e. What model is used that combines the problem parameters and machine parameters to predict performance?**  \n",
    "  \n",
    "A: For local computation, per-component benchmarks like matrix multiplication were performed on single node or GPU to provide actual local computation cost on certain system, which then help predict the overall perfrormance. For communication, by dividing the amount of data each node must sned by the injection bandwidth of that node, they preidcted a lower bounds for the completion time of each call. Overall performance wasn't predicted in the paper. Instead, actual performance is reported, and efficiency was calculated by dividing the achieved flop/s by peak flop/s measured. \n",
    "\n",
    "**f. Any paper that is submitted for a prize contains some marketing, and maybe some attempts to [fool the masses](https://blogs.fau.de/hager/archives/category/fooling-the-masses).  If you could ask the authors to submit one additional figure with the performance measurements of an experiment, what would you choose, and why?**  \n",
    "  \n",
    "A: I would ask the authors to add a figure about how the performance of cuPLAS and DaCe (SBSMM) change with the size of individual matrices used in the strided matrix multiplication. Because they claimed that cuBLAS excessively padded small matrices, hence the useful flops is low, although the seemingly high peak percentage. If the figure does support their hypothesis, we should expect something like the performance of cuBLAS increases with the size of matrices included while the DaCe doesn't. "
